============

This is going to be a c++/of port of Karsten Schmidt's (toxi) ToxicLibs. 

My plan is to develop this port for the next weeks/months, but never put 100% of my time and concentration on it. I hope I will make it to the end without being too distracted by other things. You're invited to port a couple of classes - some help is highly appreciated!
